# Secure Login System

## Overview
This project implements a secure login system using Node.js, Express, and MySQL. The system allows users to register, log in, and access their profiles securely. This README provides information on setting up the project, testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities, and mitigating security risks.

## Features
- User registration with password hashing
- User authentication using session management
- Secure login and logout functionality
- Dashboard

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure the database connection in `app.js`.
4. Create the necessary database tables using the provided SQL scripts.
5. Run the application using `npm start`.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [Setup Guide](./docs/setup.md).

## Testing for SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
Thoroughly test the application for SQL injection vulnerabilities to ensure its security. Use various input techniques and automated tools to identify and mitigate potential risks.

For testing instructions and examples, see the [Testing Guide](./docs/testing.md).

## Mitigating Vulnerabilities
Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities in the application. Follow best practices for secure database interactions to protect against potential attacks.

For mitigation strategies and code examples, refer to the [Mitigation Guide](./docs/mitigation.md).

## Code Documentation
Thoroughly document the codebase, focusing on SQL queries and database interactions. Explain the importance of parameterized queries and provide clear examples of vulnerable and fixed code snippets.

For detailed code documentation, see the [Code Documentation](./docs/code-documentation.md) page.

## Deployment
Deploy the login system to a production environment following best practices for security and scalability. Ensure that sensitive information is protected, and the application is accessible over HTTPS.

For deployment guidance, refer to the [Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment.md).
