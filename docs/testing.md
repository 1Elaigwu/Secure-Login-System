# Testing Guide

Thoroughly test the application for SQL injection vulnerabilities using the following techniques:

1. **Test Known Injection Techniques:**
   - Try injecting single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), semicolons (`;`), SQL keywords (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.), and comment characters (`--`, `/*`, `*/`) into input fields.
   - Example: Enter `' OR 1=1; --` as the username or password.

2. **Test Input Fields:**
   - Test all input fields in the application, including login fields, registration fields, search fields, and any other fields that interact with the database.

3. **Test Boundary Values:**
   - Test boundary values to see how the application handles different lengths of input. Try entering long strings, special characters, and empty strings.

4. **Test Error Handling:**
   - Test how the application handles errors. Enter incorrect data types or malformed input and check if the application displays detailed error messages.

5. **Test Authentication Bypass:**
   - Attempt to bypass authentication by manipulating SQL queries. For example, try entering `admin' OR '1'='1` as the username or password.

6. **Test Privilege Escalation:**
   - Attempt to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges by manipulating SQL queries. Try entering `admin'; DROP TABLE users; --` as the username or password.

Monitor server logs for any unusual activity or errors that may indicate attempted SQL injection attacks.

Consider using automated SQL injection testing tools such as SQLMap or OWASP ZAP to scan your application for vulnerabilities.
