# Mitigation Guide

Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities in the application. Follow these steps to secure the application against potential attacks:

1. **Use Parameterized Queries:**
   - Refactor SQL queries to use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
   - Parameterized queries separate SQL logic from data, preventing attackers from injecting malicious code into queries.

2. **Sanitize Input Data:**
   - Validate and sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.
   - Use input validation libraries or built-in language features to sanitize input data.

3. **Avoid Dynamic Queries:**
   - Avoid dynamically constructing SQL queries using string concatenation.
   - Use ORM libraries or query builders that automatically handle parameterization.

4. **Educate Developers:**
   - Educate developers on the importance of secure coding practices and the risks associated with SQL injection vulnerabilities.
   - Provide training and resources on writing secure SQL queries and using parameterized queries effectively.
